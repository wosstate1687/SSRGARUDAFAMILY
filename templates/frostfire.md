# Frostfire Mine
## Alliance Message
```
For Frostfire Mine: 
1. Stay on the outskirts, where there are mostly level 1 or level 2 mines. Don't teleport close to the middle. 
2. Choose skills: right, right, left, left, right. 
3. Try to attack as many guards as possible with all of your marches. 
4. Once every minute conquer a new mine and recall your troops. 
5. When an outbreak happens, gather from special mines with all of your marches. Use a special skill that is available once every five minutes. When it's done, return to killing guards.
```
```
Frostfire Mine continuation: 
Using this strategy with those skills, will allow you to gain a big amount of points by:
1. Killing Guards (main way of getting points) 
2. Conquering new mines (gathering from them is useless, don't do this) 
3. Gathering a lot during vein outbursts.
4. Looting from mines.
