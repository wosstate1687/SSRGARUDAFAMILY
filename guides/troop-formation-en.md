# TROOPS FORMATION GUIDE
When you're opening or joining someone's rally or reinforce some garrison, it is important to use the proper heroes and efficient troop tatio. The best heroes with will depend on your state age and alliance you are part of. 

## Troops Squad and Rally Mechanics

A **Squad** consists of up to 3 heroes: one **Lancer**, one **Marksman**, and one **Infantry** hero (in any order) and soldiers of these types. Each hero has two sets of skills: **Expedition** and **Exploration**. **Expedition skills** are the only ones that matter in rallies or garrison reinforcements. As a **rally leader**, all **Expeditionary skills** from your squad are applied to the entire rally. As a **rally member**, only the **top-right (1st)** **Expedition skill** of your first hero counts.

#### Choose correct heroes!
- For offensive rallies, focus on heroes with strong **Damage Up**, **Attack Up** skills.
- Avoid heroes with non-offensive skills such as **Chief Stamina Cost Down** or **Income Boosts** (e.g., **Gina**, **Cloris**, **Smith**), as these provide no offensive benefit to the rally.

### **Joining a Rally**
- When **joining** a rally, only the **#1 Expedition skill** (top-right skill) of your **first hero** will be activated.
- If the **first 4 players** to join have **Level 5 top-right skills**, those will be activated, regardless of what heroes others join with.
- If the **first 4 players** have skills at different levels, and someone joins with a **higher-level skill of the same hero**, it will replace the skill with the lower level. The **highest-level skill** always takes priority.

Lets consider Offensive Skills Efficiency of some heroes for Rally Joiners:
- **Jessie**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Jasser**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Jeronimo**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Seo-Yoon**: **Attack Up** – Increases attack by **25%** at max level. Solid, but not as impactful as **Damage Up**.  
- **Mia**: **Enemy Damage Taken Up** – **50% chance** to increase enemy damage taken by **50%** for **3 turns**. Chance-based, but can amplify the effectiveness of your attacks.  
- **Flint**: **Damage Up Chance** – **20% chance** to increase damage by **40%** per turn for **3 turns**. Chance-based, high potential but unpredictable.  
- **Philly**: **Attack Up** – Increases attack by **15%** at max level. Smaller than other offensive skills, less impactful.

So,
- **Best choice**: **Jessie**, **Jasser**, and **Jeronimo** with their **guaranteed 25% damage boost**.  
- **Second Best**: **Seo-Yoon** with a **solid 25% attack boost**.  
- **Chance-based**: **Mia** and **Flint** have unpredictable but potentially strong effects.  
- **Least Effective**: **Philly** with a smaller **15% attack boost**.

### **Opening a Rally**

When **opening** a rally, **all Expeditionary skills** from your squad’s heroes will be activated. **SSR (Yellow)** heroes are optimal for rally leaders due to their versatile combination of offensive and defensive skills provided by their three Expeditionary skills. However, preference should be given to heroes whose skills are developed to the maximum level. Additionally, the source of the bonus troops (including the chief's battle tech power, hero power, hero gear power, chief charm power, and pet power) in the rally always comes from the rally leader. Therefore, the strongest heroes should be prioritized to maximize the rally’s effectiveness.
