# TROOPS FORMATION GUIDE
When you're opening or joining someone's rally or reinforce some garrison, it is extremely important you use the proper heroes and efficient troop tatio. The best heroes with will depend on your state age and alliance you are part of.

## Rallies

## **Troops Squad and Rally Mechanics**

A **Troops Squad** consists of 3 heroes: one **Lancer**, one **Marksman**, and one **Infantry** hero (in any order). Each hero has 2 sets of skills: **Expeditionary** and **Exploration** skills. When you join or start a rally, or reinforce a garrison, only **Expeditionary** skills matter. Depending on your role as a **rally leader** or **rally member**, different skills of your squad will impact the rally in various ways. 

#### Choose correct heroes!
- For offensive rallies, focus on heroes with strong **Damage Up**, **Attack Up** skills.
- Avoid heroes with non-offensive skills such as **Damage Taken Down**, **Chief Stamina Cost Down**, **Stun Chance**, or **Income Boosts** (e.g., **Gina**, **Cloris**, **Smith**), as these provide no offensive benefit to the rally.

### **Joining a Rally**
- When **joining** a rally, only the **#1 Expeditionary skill** (top-right skill) of your **first hero** will be activated.
- If the **first 4 players** to join have **Level 5 top-right skills**, those will be activated, regardless of what heroes others join with.
- If the **first 4 players** have skills at different levels, and someone joins with a **higher-level skill of the same hero**, it will replace the skill with the lower level. The **highest-level skill** always takes priority.

Lets consider Offensive Skills Efficiency of some heroes for Rally Joiners:
- **Jessie**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Jasser**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Jeronimo**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Seo-Yoon**: **Attack Up** – Increases attack by **25%** at max level. Solid, but not as impactful as **Damage Up**.  
- **Mia**: **Enemy Damage Taken Up** – **50% chance** to increase enemy damage taken by **50%** for **3 turns**. Chance-based, but can amplify the effectiveness of your attacks.  
- **Flint**: **Damage Up Chance** – **20% chance** to increase damage by **40%** per turn for **3 turns**. Chance-based, high potential but unpredictable.  
- **Philly**: **Attack Up** – Increases attack by **15%** at max level. Smaller than other offensive skills, less impactful.

So,
- **Best choice**: **Jessie**, **Jasser**, and **Jeronimo** with their **guaranteed 25% damage boost**.  
- **Second Best**: **Seo-Yoon** with a **solid 25% attack boost**.  
- **Chance-based**: **Mia** and **Flint** have unpredictable but potentially strong effects.  
- **Least Effective**: **Philly** with a smaller **15% attack boost**.


### **Opening a Rally**
When **opening** a rally, **all the Expeditionary skills** of your squad's heroes will be activated. This makes **SSR (Yellow)** heroes optimal for rally leaders, as they provide a **versatile combination of offensive and defensive skills** with their three Expeditionary skills.
