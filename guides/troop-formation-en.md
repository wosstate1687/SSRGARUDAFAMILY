# TROOPS FORMATION GUIDE
When you're opening or joining someone's rally or reinforce some garrison, it is important to use the proper heroes and efficient troop tatio. The best heroes with will depend on your state age and alliance you are part of. 

## Troops Squad and Rally Mechanics

A **Squad** consists of up to 3 heroes: one **Lancer**, one **Marksman**, and one **Infantry** hero (in any order) and soldiers of these types. Each hero has two sets of skills: **Expedition** and **Exploration**. **Expedition skills** are the only ones that matter in rallies or garrison reinforcements. As a **rally leader**, all **Expedition skills** from your squad are applied to the entire rally. As a **rally member**, only the **top-right (1st)** **Expedition skill** of your first hero counts. [Check here the list of Epedition skills](http://wosstate1687.github.io/SSRGARUDAFAMILY/guides/heroes-exp-skills-en) of heroes.

#### Choose correct heroes!

- For offensive rallies, focus on heroes with strong **Damage Up**, **Attack Up** skills.
- Avoid heroes with non-offensive skills such as **Chief Stamina Cost Down** or **Income Boosts** (e.g., **Gina**, **Cloris**, **Smith**), as these provide no offensive benefit to the rally.

### **Joining a Rally**
- When **joining** a rally, only the **#1 Expedition skill** (top-right skill) of your **first hero** will be activated.
- If the **first 4 players** to join have **Level 5 top-right skills**, those will be activated, regardless of what heroes others join with.
- If the **first 4 players** have skills at different levels, and someone joins with a **higher-level skill of the same hero**, it will replace the skill with the lower level. The **highest-level skill** always takes priority.

#### **Recommended Heroes for Rally Members**
- **Best choice**:
  -  **Jessie, Jasser, Jeronimo**: **Damage Up** – Increases damage by **25%** at max level. Reliable and guaranteed damage boost.  
- **Second Best**:
  - **Seo-Yoon**: **Attack Up** –  Guaranteed **25% attack boost**.
- **Chance-based** (high potential but unpredictable):
  - **Mia**: **Enemy Damage Taken Up** – **50% chance** to increase enemy damage taken by **50%** for **3 turns**. 
  - **Flint**: **Damage Up Chance** – **20% chance** to increase damage by **40%** per turn for **3 turns**. 
- **Least Effective**:
  - **Philly**: **Attack Up** – Increases attack by **15%** at max level. (use only if skill level maxed)

### **Opening a Rally**

When **opening** a rally, **all Expeditionary skills** from your squad’s heroes are activated. The bonus (including **chief's battle tech power**, **hero power**, **hero gear power**, **chief charm power**, and **pet power**) comes from the rally leader. To maximize **offensive** and **defensive** benefits, **Rally Leaders** should focus on **SSR heroes** with **max-level Expedition skills** (across all 3 skills).
